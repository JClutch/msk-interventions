# MSK Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `To get started:`

```
git clone https://github.com/JClutch/msk-interventions.git
msk-interventions
npm install
npm start
```

## Deployment

[Published on Heroku](http://msk-coding-challenge.herokuapp.com/).
*Keep in mind free tier Heroku is very slow on initial launch*

## Future Thoughts
- Unit / Integration Tests
- Extend Search Options (i.e. size, count, codes)
- Form Validation
- Brand styling/global CSS
- Re-usable styling with SASS or SCSS
- Light/Dark Mode
- Custom style sheets for devices (i.e. mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Application Server to host in memory cache with expiring entries for searches
- Extend number of search results and enable infinite scrolling + lazy loading
- Noticed the API has documentation for "Fetching Daily Updates" - Potential for user settings and subscription model for trials
